# Team++ media API server

> The API serving all assets and media files for our podcasts.

## Why an API?

We created this API ~~because APIs are cool~~ **because we need a media (and metadata!) hosting solution serving all stuff like duration, file sizes etc. required to run the websites or build iTunes compatible feeds.**

If our current hoster [Uberspace](http://uberspace.de) is not powerful enough (shared hosting!) to handle all that requests and traffic in the future, we will just be able to move that API to a dedicated server and everything will work like before.
